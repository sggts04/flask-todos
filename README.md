# Todos WebApp
This is a Todos WebApp built in Flask, currently with no user system, and no database, only json files.

## Installation
For testing, editing or playing around with the code, you can download the app to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/sggts04/flask_todos
cd flask_todos
pip install flask
python app.py
```
The site will be available on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ then. However, the live site is [here](http://sggts04.pythonanywhere.com/) which you can't edit :)    
Delete all content of the json file except a ```{ }``` to start off fresh.
## Example
A live example of this is running on http://sggts04.pythonanywhere.com/

This site is however expected to be on a more updated state than the github repo.
