# Todos WebApp
This is the code for Todos WebApp built in Flask, currently with no user system, and no database, only json files. The site is live on http://sggts04.pythonanywhere.com/   

## Installation
For testing, editing or playing around with the code, you can download the app to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/sggts04/flask_todos
cd flask_todos
pip install flask
python app.py
```
The app will be available on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ then. However, the live site is [here](http://sggts04.pythonanywhere.com/) which you can't edit :)    
Delete all content of the json file except a ```{ }``` to start off fresh.
